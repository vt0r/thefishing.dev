## Sample post

Testing. 1...2...3... Real content is coming soon! Just tidying up this theme to make it look better and be more accessible first!

``` toml
[[menu.main]]
    name  = "About"
    url   = "/about/"
    weight = 10

[[menu.main]]
    name  = "Contact"
    url   = "/contact/"
    weight = 20

[params.share]
    enable = false
    facebook = false
    twitter = false
    linkedin = false
    email = false
```
